                        My interest in board games as a hobby started when I was a kid and my family would have regular family game nights.
                        I enjoy the unique social interaction board games provided. It is a way to both use problem solving skills while 
                        socializing at the same time. I have further expanded my interest in the hobby by joining local table top gaming groups
                        and expanding my collection of games. Board games offer a variety of mental and social challenges that are unique to
                        its medium and I don't think I will ever get tired of them.

                            I enjoy hiking for the sense of adventure it provides. Getting a pack of supplies and taking a trip in to the
                            wilderness even just for a few hours is like a miniature trip to get away from the daily stresses of life. 
                            The solitude of being away from the world helps provide a good environment for self reflection. I also enjoy the
                            feeling of satisfaction when reaching a scenic view or completing a hard climb up and down a mountain.

                            I enjoy working with computers in a lot of different ways. I enjoy working on both the hardware and software
                            aspects. I think computers provide a neat way of problem solving and interacting with the world. Working on 
                            complicated problems with in a unique set of rules is something I enjoy and the digital logic that computers 
                            work on provides that environment. I have worked with many different aspects of computers from programing in
                            assembly to designing PCBs.

                        During this time I was working part time at Avionics Interface Technologies in Omaha as a technical intern 
                        while I was studying Computer Engineering at UNO. I programed primarily in C++ and Python to write test
                        code for equipment used to test various avionics components. During this I also learned about software version
                        control using Tortoise SVN and  automated testing using Jenkins. For personal reasons I was unable to finish
                        my degree in computer engineering and enlisted in the US Air Force.

                        I enlisted into the US Air Force as a Client Systems Technician and was stationed at Hill AFB in Utah. There I worked
                        in a tier 2 IT support role working on fixing client side computer components. In September 2020 I was deployed 
                        to Afghanistan for three months and then to Kuwait until April 2021 to support on going joint operations. 
                        During this time I preformed IT support for client devices and as worked as a network administrator.

                        I transferred to the US Space Force while I was deployed as part of the first round of enlisted transfers from the
                        Air Force. I then moved to Schriever SFB in Colorado Springs to support the Space Force mission there. Currently I
                        am in training to change to a software development job in the Space Force. The training I am currently receiving is 
                        a 13 week software development boot camp run by Galvanize. The boot camp teaches
                        software development with Javascript and other tools to support application development and testing.
